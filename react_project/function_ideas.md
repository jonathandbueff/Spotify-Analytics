Recover accidentally deleted songs:
- It's too easy to delete songs from playlists. Pressing the delete key or swiping left on a song will delete the song without asking user to confirm deletion
- An idea to recover lost songs would be to look at streaming history, ID songs that are played over a certain amount of times (say 20), and then check if these songs are in any playlists

Temp playlists to aggregate smaller playlists:
- Some users create playlists and add songs up until they reach a certain limit (40-50 songs) and move onto a new playlist.
- Some users create playlists chronologically (for example, creating a playlist for each month)
- This causes a problem because users end up not being able to listen much to the songs added at the end of a playlist's "lifecycle"
- Likewise, songs added at the beginning of a playlist's "lifecycle" might end up being overplayed due to the small playlist size.
- A solution would be to combine playlists (or parts of playlists) so the user is able to enjoy songs on multiple playlists without having to switch back and forth.

Track historical shifts in music taste

Reactive Shuffle Playlist:
- When a user plays a playlist on shuffle and skips a song, have the playlist update (live) the upcoming tracks to filter out similar songs to the one skipped.
- On demand playlist updating
